# grid_continuity_SMB
Collection of MATLAB codes and scripts to estimate SMB based on remote sensing observations of velocity and surface elevation changes, with ice thickness estimates. 

Includes example input data for Rongbuk Glacier.

## Prerequisites

You need:
 - activated version of MATLAB (R2017a or more recent)
 - Mapping Toolbox to ingest Geotiff information

Other dependencies are included in /code

## Installing

Simply clone the repository, then adjust the master_FluxCalcsSimple.m script to get going. Example data are included for Rongbuk Glacier. Ensure that input velocity data (dx, dy) are relative to their coordinate system.
